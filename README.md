# ChadMusic - The Chad Music Bot
ChadMusic is music bot that supports over 700+ websites and has filter support. Based off of DisTube.js, the bot was originally inspired off of Tony, another music bot that supported a lot of sources, and allowed filters to be applied.

Things you can do with ChadMusic:
- Play sources from any site that YouTube-DL supports. YouTube, Soundcloud, Twitch, etc.
- Unlimited Volume! The sky is the limit!
- Apply filters to the player, with more being added in the future!

ChadMusic has its downsides however:
- You cannot play live radio.
- Spotify does not work. (Support will be added later.)
- You can only apply one filter at a time.

âš  This bot is still a work in progress. There may be a hiccup here and there, and some features that are present in the bot's settings page are not fully implemented.
