# All of this looks cool! Can I self host this?
Sure, why not? Read the instructions below.

## Directions
The bot requires Node.JS 16.0.0 to run. The latest LTS release is recommended.
1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a bot application **[here](https://discord.com/developers)**, and copy the bot's token.
3. Fill out the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
4. Type `npm run build` to install all dependencies 

5. Run `node index` to run the bot. (Consider using a process manager like PM2 to keep it running in the background.)
