# All of this looks cool! Can I self host this?
Self-hosting ChadMusic is not supported, but I will not stop you from doing so as long as you abide by the MIT License. Since this bot is based on **[DisTube.js](https://distube.js.org)**, I encourage you to learn how to build your own music bot to your taste. If any of this seems scary to you, again you can always **[add this bot to your server.](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=375450533114413056&permissions=1005972566&scope=applications.commands%20bot)**

## Directions
The bot requires Node.JS 14.0.0 to run.
1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a bot application **[here](https://discord.com/developers)**, and copy the bot's token.
3. Fill out the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
4. Type `npm install` in the bot's directory to install all of its dependencies.
5. Run `node index` to run the bot. (Consider using a process manager like PM2 to keep it running in the background.)
