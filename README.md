If you're running the bot on Linux, the following packages are required.

- `gcc`
- `clang`
- `g++`

## Directions
1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a bot application **[here](https://discord.com/developers)**, and copy the bot's token.
3. Fill out the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
4. Type `npm run build` to install all dependencies.
    - It's safe to ignore any TypeScript errors that occur during the build. If any other errors occur during the process, please open an issue regarding this.

5. Type `npm run bot` or `node index` to run the bot. (Consider using a process manager like PM2 to keep it running in the background.)
