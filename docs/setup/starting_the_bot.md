# Starting the bot
If you followed the installation guide section-by-section, you should now be able to run the bot for the first time. You can start the bot by running the following command:

```
$ npm run bot
```

Alternatively, you can also launch the bot by using the following command:

```
$ node index.js
```

Your bot should now be online and ready to use. Head over to the Commands section to see what the bot can really do. Enjoy!
