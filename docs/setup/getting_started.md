# Getting Started
To host your own instance of ChadMusic, please follow the instructions section-by-section to get your own copy of the bot up and running.

!!! note "For Linux users"

    This guide assumes that you plan to host the bot on a Debian/Ubuntu based distribution or Fedora. The bot will work on any ditribution of your choosing. If you plan to use a different distribution, replace certain commands with the ones that your distribution uses.

## Inviting my bot
As an alternative to self-hosting your own instance, you can try out ChadMusic for yourself by inviting my own personal bot to give it a spin.

[:material-robot: Invite the bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=375450533114413056&permissions=41099548028374&scope=bot%20applications.commands){ .md-button }

Understand though that my bot is considered "semi-public".

* The bot is limited to 50 servers. It's under a first come, first serve basis.
* The bot may leave at anytime for any reason.
* It preiodically runs an in development build of ChadMusic.

If you don't wan't to add the bot to your server, you can try out the bot on the support server instead.
