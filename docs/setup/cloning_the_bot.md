# Cloning the bot
Once everything is installed to your system, go to a directory that you can easily access to download the bot to, and clone the bot's repository by running the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/200percentmicky/chadmusic.git
```

After cloning, you should be on the `main` branch. This branch is use to track the stable release of the bot. You can check which branch you're on by running the following:

```
$ git status
```

If you wish to run an in-development version of the bot, you can switch to the `develop` branch by running the following:

```
$ git checkout develop
```

!!! warning

    It's not recommended to use the `develop` branch in production as bugs may be present.
